## Google Sponsored Computational Resources

We are very grateful to Google, who have kindly offered to sponsor 100 USD coupons for Google cloud compute resources for participants of this challenge. Teams that have made a valid submission are invited to send an email to [ wsdm-cup-2019@spotify.com ](wsdm-cup-2019@spotify.com){:target='_blank'} to request a coupon. This email should have the title 'Coupon' and should provide the team name, and should be sent from the email associated with the account which made the valid submission. Every week a team makes an improved submission on the leaderboard, they will be eligible to request a further 100 USD coupon, for as long as coupons remain. Thus, if a team has already received a coupon, but makes an improved submission in the subsequent week starting Monday, they will be eligible for another request.
