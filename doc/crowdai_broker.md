### crowdAI Broker

**TODO: Out of date** 

[Component Repo](https://github.com/spMohanty/crowdai-grading-server). Note that this will be renamed to be the **crowdAI Broker**.

This is a queuing and coordination system between the other nodes. It runs on a single server running on EC2 and be written in Python and using [socket.io](https://socket.io/) for client communication. Redis will be used to manage internal queues.

The broker will coordinate all work for crowdAI, and perform the following functions:

- Retrieve Challenge configuration from the Rails Webapp
- Accept Authentication from client
- Accept submissions from clients
- Validate the participant API key and Challenge Identifier
- Provide a session token to the client
- Send submissions to the **crowdAI Grader**
- Post grades to the **crowdAI Webapp** on the leaderboard
- Accept submitted code and post to Gitlab to a private repo, with a user's permission at the per submission level. At the end of the challenge the repo will be made public.
- Communicate submission results back to the client
- Provide grading progress visual to the client
